# SIG-Guest-Languages

Special Interest Group (SIG) whose to coordinate the development of [WebAssembly Components](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) into guest programming language ecosystems in a way that feels native to those ecosystems.

Goals of the group include:

* Coordinating shared tools and approaches for Component Model support across guest language projects.
* Creating an overview of the component support and features provided across language ecosystems.
* Developing resources for onboarding new languages.
* Hosting language toolchain-specific [subgroup meetings](docs/subgroups.md) where more involved collaboration is needed.

# Subgroups

This document is a proposal to create subgroups of the dynamic languages SIG.
All subgroups will be viewed as a part of SIG-Dynamic-Languages and adhere to all of its rules.

For a subgroup to be formed, there must be two or more members supporting its creation who have agreed to become its organizing members.
Organizing members are responsible for scheduling and running, meetings and upholding the Bytecode Alliance Code of Conduct.

Only one kind of subgroup is proposed initially, but this may be extended by future proposals.

Subgroups and their organizing members are listed in this document. Any proposed subgroups or changes to the organizing members of a subgroup must be submitted as a PR to the governance repository, placed on the agenda for a SIG-Dynamic-Languages at least a week before its next meeting, and accepted by a vote.

## Language-Specific Subgroups

A language-specific subgroup will be focused on a single programming language ecosystem and
exist to further the Wasm support for that language.

The language-specific subgroups are

* Python - organized by
  * Joel Dice (Fermyon)
  * Kevin Smith (SingleStore)
* JavaScript & TypeScript (JS/TS) - organized by
  * Calvin Prewitt (JAF Labs)
  * Sa√∫l Cabrera (Shopify)
